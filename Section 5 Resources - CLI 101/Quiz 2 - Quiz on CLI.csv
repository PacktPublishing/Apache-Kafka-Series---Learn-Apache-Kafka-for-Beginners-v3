"When a topic is auto-created, how many partitions and replication factor does it have by default?",multiple-choice,partitions: 3replication factor: 1,partitions: 1replication factor: 1,partitions: 3replication factor: 3,2,"by default it's 1 & 1, but these can be controlled by the settings num.partitions and default.replication.factor"
