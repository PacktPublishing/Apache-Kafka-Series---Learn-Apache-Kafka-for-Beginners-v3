Kafka Connect Hands-On: Warning


The next lecture is really advanced and I go quite fast.

If you cannot reproduce what I do, do not worry, this lecture is optional and not necessary to complete to finish the course. Kafka Connect takes about 3 hours to learn properly, and this one lecture is meant as an introduction to show you the power of it.



Happy learning!
